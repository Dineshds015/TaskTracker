## Overview

This is a task management application built with React. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with features such as marking tasks as completed, updating the task list, and saving tasks in the browser's local storage. The app leverages modern React features like **Automatic Batching**, **Concurrent Mode**, and **Suspense for Data Fetching** to provide a smooth and performant user experience.
